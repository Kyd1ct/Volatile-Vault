# Volatile-Vault
Volatile Vault: Unlock the secrets hidden within.

In this digital forensics challenge, you will receive a memory dump filled with real and fake data. Your mission is to sift through the fake data and find the hidden sacred texts. This challenge will test your ability to identify patterns and anomalies in volatile memory dumps and understand Windows' architecture. Completing this challenge requires patience, persistence, and a keen eye for detail. Good luck!

The raw memory dump cannot be directly uploaded to GitHub due to its large size. The file can be obtained through the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDY8ybJYkYj1kY8-vQ_dWU2DDg-27pRb/view?usp=sharing. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
